# Multiple Linear Regression with Interaction Effects for Load Forecasting


## Project description
Accurately forecasting electric load lies at the heart of  power  system  operation  routines  such  as  economic  dispatch and optimal power flow. For this reason, there is a lot of interest  on  developing  accurate  models for  predicting  electric  load  over  recent  years.  Prior  art  in  this domain used time-series and linear regression as means of coming up  with  good  forecasting  models.  In this project, we use multiple regression with interaction effects to develop a new model that can accurate predict electric load from several features.  We  validate  different  models  and  quantify  their  performance  via both standard  goodness of fit criteria such as the adjusted $R^2$ as well as criteria that rely on the test set.
